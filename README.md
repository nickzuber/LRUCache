# Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache

>A finite key-value cache data structure that implements the [Least Recently Used (LRU) caching algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms). Entries within the cache are stored in order by time last accessed, and as the cache reaches maximum capacity, the lest recently accessed entries are evicted.

*Still under development*
